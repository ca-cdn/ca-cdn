Theme Notes;
This template/theme is the result of many hours of template editing in order to resolve a few issues with certain browsers as well as cleaning up/refining the HTML code and is to be the base template for any further themes we create.
We have changed quite a few things around including the introduction of just one size of folder image. Please see the Forum Images web site for full details.
Any changes to colours and fonts will have to be done via the external style sheet (fisubgreen.css)
We do not release the source files for creating the graphics used in any of our themes.

----
Support;
Although this theme has been thoroughly tested we would prefer that any support requests for this theme are made via the community forums at the main phpBB Web Site;
http://www.phpbb.com/ 
This support is restricted to any problems you may have with installing it on a standard distribution of phpBB - no support will be given for modified boards and/or the installation of third party MODs.

----
Installation;
Uncompress the fisubice.zip archive (using such as Winzip) into your phpBB templates directory, making sure that the file and directory structure is retained, e.g. phpBB/templates/fisubice 
Log into the phpBB Administration Panel. 
Click on Add under the Styles Administration title. 
If all is present and correct you should see the fisubice name listed under Style and Template. Click on Install at the side of the fisubice name under the Action title. 
The fisubice theme should then be available for you and your users to choose from.
